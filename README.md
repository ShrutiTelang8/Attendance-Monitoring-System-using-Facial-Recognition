# Attendance-Monitoring-System-using-Facial-Recognition

This attendance monitoring system used facial recognition technology for attendance verification. The system captured student faces using webcam (60 snapshots of a student in a frame of given size). It then used OpenCV package to convert these snapshots into grayscale. A Haar cascade classifier was used for detecting the face structure and eyes. The normalized images were stored under student login credentials and the data was trained using a Local Binary Patterns(LBP) classifier. The system could recognizes student faces and stored details in an excel sheet with date and time of student attendance.  

GUI using for this project was developed using Tkinter!
